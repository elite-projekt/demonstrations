We live in a time of increasing digitalization which results in an increased dependency on IT systems. This again leads to an increased potential of harm, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) - "kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMU)".  In most cases, these companies do not have a sufficient understanding of IT security and clear competencies to act in the event of a an attack.

The aim of the project is to develop a platform that uses interactive demonstrators in order to teach scenarios of common IT security attacks and appropriate countermeasures. Additionally, it is supposed to provide an easy-to-understand and accessible background knowledge i.e. with posters, brochures and videos.

## Project Overview

The Gitlab-Group holds all repositories that emerged within the master course "Experience Cyber Security".

1. Demonstrations: This repository contains all demos for the platform as well as the nativeapp.
1. Teaching: This repository holds the platform web application which controls the demos and contains the teaching material.
1. Container Templates: This repository builds the needed basic containers to speedup build time for the project containers.

## Getting Started

The sidebar has an overview of the wiki entries. For a good starting point read the following pages:

1. [Project management and contribution](Project management and contribution).

### MPSE Course "Experience Cyber Security"

Since the project was started, multiple teams have been contributing as follows:

1. Teaching/Web Platform: This team is responsible for implementing the general infrastructure of the ECS system and the platform itself.
1. Demonstrations: This team is responsible for design and implementation of the demonstrations. The repository holds all the demonstrations of different scenarios (Phishing, Password, etc.)
1. Teaching: Teaching Portal including all teaching material.
1. Infrastructure: This team is responsible for the improvement of the CI/CD pipeline, quality control and the deployment process.
1. Demo Improvement: This team is maintaining quality of the teaching material as well as the code quality of the native app and all demos.
1. Drive-By Download: This demo is responsible for for creating the new drive-by download demo and the corresponding teaching material.
