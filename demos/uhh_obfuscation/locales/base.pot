"Hi Max,\n\n"
"For our planned cyberattack on the competitor company i prepared a little Ransomware script for you.\n"
"This Ransomware will, once executed on a computer of the competitor company, encrypt as many files as possible and effectively take their files hostage.\n"
"At the moment we need to face the problem that the Windows Defender, which is the antivirus program the competitor company uses, currently detects our Ransomware as a virus.\n"
"Because of that if we would deploy the Ransomware now, the attack would probably fail because their antivirus would block the program.\n"
"To tackle that problem, I uploaded the Ransomware, an obfuscation program and a testscan program to your desktop.\n"
"The obfuscation program has the purpose of obfuscating the Ransomware to a state so that the Windows Defender does not detect is as a virus anymore.\n"
"The testscan program is just a simple script that automatically scans the Ransomware with Windows Defender and then outputs if the antivirus found a virus inside of the Ransomware.\n"
"Here is your To-Do list:\n\n"
"    1. Please run the testscan program first. This will scan the normal Ransomware. You will find that it will get detected.\n"
"    2. After that, use our obfuscation program at https://nimbus.de/obfuscation to obfuscate the Ransomware. Further instructions are given in the obfuscation program itself.\n"
"    3. Once you completed the obfuscation process, please run the testscan program once again.\n\n"
"After completing all of the above, you will hopefully find that the Ransomware will not be detected anymore. Good luck !\n\n"
"Yours sincerely\n"
"Christina"
