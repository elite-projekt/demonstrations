  Hello Max,

  I am really sorry to say this, but I accidentally sent you the wrong USB-Stick.
  The correct one had been in my drawer, I just now found it there. The one I sent to you is never recognized and always gives me errors. Actually I should have thrown it away a long time ago.

  Right now I am trying to upload the images to our system. Even though so far only a few pictures are available, I would be glad if you could take a look at them already.

  Sadly, our new guidelines against Phishing-Attacks prevent me from sending you the URL, but it should be saved in your favorites already.
  Please only use the "Edge"-Browser for this as the website only works fine in that browser.

  Yours sincerely
  Christina
